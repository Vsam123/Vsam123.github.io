			<h2>History</h2>
			<img src="photos/lodge.png" alt="lodge" class="TextWrap">
			<p>Freemasonry is simply a fraternal organization with a long and intricate history. It is thought to have originated as a guild for stonemasons during medieval Europe. See, Dad? I mean it makes sense. Stone-MASONS? Masonry… Yeah, I’m sure you got it.
				So basically these stonemasons, who were responsible for constructing some of the grandest cathedrals, castles, and other significant structures, (I know how much you love your architecture, especially cathedrals) developed a system of secret codes and symbols to protect their trade secrets and recognize each other.
				As the stonemason guilds evolved, they attracted members from various fields, including architects, engineers, and scholars. You know I am majoring in engineering, I could be Mason for all you know. And then these Masons from various fields became interested in philosophical and spiritual matters, incorporating symbols and rituals from ancient religions and mystery traditions.
				In the 17th century, Freemasonry became a more formal organization with lodges and a system of degrees. The lodges are similar to the one right next to our old apartment. I believe its called the Advance Masonic Temple.

			<p>However, these lodges began to attract members from all walks of life, including politicians, scientists, and artists. And during the Enlightenment period, Freemasonry became associated with the concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity.
				Famous founding fathers of the United States, such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Paul Revere, were also Freemasons, and they incorporated Masonic symbols and principles into the design of the new nation.				
			</p>
			<p>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Freemasonry continued to expand and transform, playing a significant role in important social and political movements, including the abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, and civil rights.
				Despite its lengthy and intriguing history, Freemasonry remains shrouded in secrecy and controversy. While some people view it as a harmless and philanthropic organization promoting brotherhood, charity, and self-improvement, others believe it is a secret cult with sinister motives. I don’t know if you remember the exact details, but that Netflix documentary really made the organization seem extremely cult-like, with all the eerie background music and everything.

			<h3>Secretive ceremonies:</h3>
			<p>Freemasonry is a group that has a lot of rituals, which are symbolic ceremonies that teach members about morals and ethics. There are different rituals that Masons take part in depending on their rank within the organization. The first ritual is the initiation ceremony, which introduces new members to the group and represents their journey of self-discovery. The passing ceremony is the second ritual and shows Mason's progression from an Apprentice to a Master Mason. The degree ceremonies are a series of rituals that involve symbols and allegories and are meant to teach members about Masonic philosophy. There's also a funeral ceremony to honor deceased Masons, and an installation ceremony to transfer power from one set of officers to another. It's important to remember that the details of these rituals may vary by location and organization.</p>
			<h3>Charitable work:</h3>
			<p>Freemasonry has a strong tradition of charitable giving and community service. Many lodges sponsor events and fundraisers to support local charities and causes.</p>

			<h2>Changes to Freemasonry</h2>
			<p>Freemasonry has gone through some major changes over the past few years. One of the biggest changes is that they now allow women to join in some places around the world. Previously, the organization was exclusively open to men who believe in God. Even though they are not recognized by the main Freemasonry organization, women are starting to create their own Masonic groups.
				Another change is that Freemasonry used to be tied to Christianity. Beleiving in God was a prerequisite to becoming part of the brotherhood. However, the organization is now welcoming people of all religions, and many lodges let people of any faith join.
				The way Freemasonsry execute their practices have also changed over time. Some of the changes have been due to technology. For example, some lodges now document and attend meetings through their phones and computers. Many changes occured simply because many of the old practices have become outdated or controversial.
				Overall, Freemasonry has evolved to stay important and relevant over the years. Even though they still have some of their old beliefs and practices, they've shown that they're willing to change and adapt to keep up with the times.
