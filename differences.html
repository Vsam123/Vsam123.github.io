			<h2>Differences and Similarities</h2>
			<h3>Definition:</h3>
                <p> Freemasonry is a social club that emphasizes personal growth, ethical values, and community building. In contrast, cults are known for their intense devotion to a specific idea, person, or object, which is often considered manipulative and abnormal.
                </p>
                <h3>Membership:</h3>
                <p> When it comes to membership, Freemasonry is an inclusive organization that accepts men from all backgrounds and beliefs, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, or social status. On the other hand, cults are associated with having a political or religious agenda and may target vulnerable individuals for recruitment.
                </p>
                <h3>Boundaries:</h3>
                <p> Unlike cults, Freemasonry respects personal boundaries and does not seek to control the lives of its members. The organization encourages members to follow their own religious or philosophical beliefs while upholding moral and ethical principles.
                </p>
                <h3>Teaching Methodology:</h3>
                <p> Freemasonry uses symbols and allegories inspired by stonemasonry to teach its members about ethics, self-improvement, and charity. In contrast, cults may use tactics like brainwashing and intimidation to recruit and retain members and prevent them from leaving the group.
                </p>
                <h3>Resignation:</h3>
                <p> Leaving Freemasonry is voluntary, whereas cults may use coercion, manipulation, or psychological pressure to keep members from leaving. Freemasonry encourages its members to be active members of their community and does not require them to sever ties with family or friends.
                </p>
                <h3>Promotion of Ideas:</h3>
                <p> Promotes open-mindedness, diversity, and tolerance, whereas cults may encourage rigid thinking and intolerance toward outsiders. Finally, Freemasonry operates democratically, with checks and balances to ensure transparency and accountability, while cults tend to have a hierarchical structure with power concentrated in a small group of leaders.
                </p>
                <p>Many people mistake secretive societies with cults, due to, well not to sound redundant, but their secrecy. Just like you call me shady when I try to be secretive and hide stuff from you. However, in many of these secretive societies, such as Freemasonry, the secrecy of rituals is there to preserve and protect the rich history of the organization. So next time, you try to peak over at my messages, remember the importance of the Freemasonâ€™s secrecy.
