			<h2>What is a Cult</h2>
			<p>Cults refer to groups or movements that exhibit extreme devotion to a specific person, idea, or belief. Such groups usually have a charismatic leader who exerts significant influence over their members and utilizes manipulative or coercive tactics to maintain control. Often, cults promote beliefs or practices that are considered controversial or outside of mainstream society. In some cases, cults may also engage in illegal activities or pose a threat to their members or society as a whole. </p>
            <h2>Types of cults and their practices:</h2>

			<h3>Scientology:</h3>
            <p>Scientology is a religion that was founded in the 1950s by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard.             <img src="photos/scientology.png" alt="scientology" id="scientology">
                It is based on the idea that humans are immortal beings known as "Thetans" who have lived many past lives and that our current problems stem from negative experiences in those past lives.<img src="photos/scsymbol.png" alt="scsymbol" id="scsymbol">
                Do you remember how much we made fun of my poor brother when he accidentally said he wanted to be a scientologist instead of a scientist? We must have called him Tom Cruise for like a week! Back to the point, Scientology teaches that individuals can overcome these negative experiences through a process known as "auditing," which involves a form of counseling that is meant to help individuals become more aware of their past experiences and emotions.</p>
            <p>Scientology has been controversial due to its secretive nature and its alleged use of manipulative and coercive tactics on its members. It has also faced legal challenges, including allegations of fraud and abuse. However, the organization maintains that it is a legitimate religion and has a significant following around the world.</p>

			<h3>Jehovah's Witness:</h3>            
            <p>Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian denomination that is recognized for its unique practices and beliefs. They are well-known for their door-to-door evangelism and their rejection of some mainstream Christian beliefs. You know that thoughâ€¦ you remember they would occasionally come knock on our door back when we lived in Floral Park? <img src="photos/watchtowerJW.png" alt="watchtower" id="watchtower">
                The religion was founded in the late 19th century by Charles Taze Russell in the United States. Their beliefs are centered around the literal interpretation of the Bible, and they strictly adhere to its teachings. Some of their rituals include baptism by immersion, regular attendance at meetings, and the annual commemoration of Jesus' death through the Memorial of Christ's Death ceremony. They also refuse to participate in certain activities like blood transfusions and military service.</p>
